**Video Plan set in stone:**
[fade in *fast* from black to discord screen. *Everyone's laughing* and reminiscing about an imaginary battle they had with a tough monster]

DM: hahaha yeah...... Alright, let's get your xp and loot out of the way.
[DM types in `$cust_loot 1050gp` and `$roll 1d6` and `$cust_loot 4xHealth_Potions` via screenshare, camera zooms in on chat box]

DM: .... alllriiight, here's your gold and uh, here's your loot

D&D Bot:`Added 1050gp and 4xHealth_Potions to all players' inventory`
[zooms out]
Everyone: "nice nice" "awesome sauce" "cool cool"

[switches screen to a player's screenshare]
Player: "cool, let me check my inventory real quick"
[Camera zooms in on chatbox, Player types in `$inventory` ]

Camera zooms out and pans to direct message with bot and zooms in]
Player: "awesome"
[switches screen to DM's screenshare]

Other Player: "alright so, when's the next game?"
DM: Hmm, let's see.
[screen zooms again to chatbox, DM types `$nextgametime early`]
D&D Bot: `Suggested next time: 3:00pm UTC`

Player: Oh, I'm watching a movie at that time
Other Player: I got work tomorrow at that time
DM: Oh really?

[screen zooms again to chatbox, DM types `$nextgametime late`]
D&D Bot: `Suggested next time: 6:00pm UTC`
Player: That works for me
Other Player: Cool cool 
DM: Alright, I'll see you then

[Freeze and BLUR the screen]
input Daniel's funny text popups and have someone say:
"What you just saw was a demo of our bot being used. Which tries to make 'D&D easier for Dungeon Masters in Discord' as you saw, it handles dice rolling, inventory management, and finding the next time"
