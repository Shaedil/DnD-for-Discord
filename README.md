*Dungeons & Dragons made easier for Dungeon Masters in Discord*

**To be submitted as part of "Roll for Hacking" Hackathon by MLH**

## What is this?
Put simply, this is a Discord bot that helps Dungeon Masters (DMs) create their own D&D game in Discord.

#### Features include:
- [ ] A map generator using Radar.io's API
- [X] A multi dice roller (e.g: ``$roll 2d12``)
- [ ] 3 DM managed shops (default: "weapons", "armor", "items")
- [ ] A DM managed loot generator (req: 'currency'; opt: 'DM's custom loot option')

## Why?
As members of our D&D club here at our high-school, we've noticed that there were a few things that were inefficient.
We've noticed in our D&D club's Discord server that our DMs took too long rolling the dice, creating the world/battle maps and quests.
Our DMs were simply stuck in the 'pen and paper era' of the 1980s. As die-hard D&D enthusiasts before COVID-19, we thought this was fine and vintage like.
Until COVID-19 hit New York City and all bets were off when it came to using Discord as our medium and continuing to use the 'pen and paper' method.
So, as a gift to our DMs, we've decided to create this discord bot for the betterment of our D&D club and to appease our D&D diehard souls.
