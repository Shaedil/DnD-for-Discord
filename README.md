*Dungeons & Dragons made easier for Dungeon Masters in Discord*

**To be submitted as part of "Roll for Hacking" Hackathon by MLH**

## What is this?
Put simply, this is a Discord bot that *helps* Dungeon Masters (DMs) create their own D&D game in Discord.

### Features include:
- [ ] *Find A Time* for the next DnD session
- [X] A multi dice roller (e.g: ``$roll 2d12``)
- [X] A complete and private inventory manager
    - [X] # of items
    - [X] Items added to players' inventories by DM or D&D bot only
    - [X] Check player's inventory privately via direct message
- [X] A DM managed loot/XP generator (req: 'currency'; opt: 'DM's custom loot')

## Why?
As members of our D&D club here at our high-school, we've noticed that there were a few things that took too long.
We've noticed in our D&D club's Discord server that our DMs took too long rolling the dice, finding a time to play, and managing xp/loot/inventory
Our DMs were simply stuck in the 'pen and paper era' of the 1980s. As die-hard D&D enthusiasts before COVID-19, we thought this was fine and vintage like.
Until COVID-19 hit New York City and all bets were off when it came to using Discord as our medium and continuing to use the 'pen and paper' method.
So, as a gift to our DMs, we've decided to create this discord bot for the betterment of our D&D club and to appease our D&D diehard souls.
